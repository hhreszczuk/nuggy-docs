- **Nuggy, we, us, our** means the Nuggy business (including any related entities, as applicable).
- **OAIC** means the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
- **Personal Information** means information or an opinion about an identified person, or a person who is reasonably identifiable, whether recorded in a material form or not, and has the meaning given in the Act.

## 3. The information we collect

The types of Personal Information we collect will depend on how you use Nuggy, but may include:

- **Account and profile details**\
  Name, email address, role (e.g. shift manager, crew member), business name, location details for a venue, and any profile preferences you set.
- **Roster and shift information**\
  Shift times, positions / stations, break timing and status, team assignments, and related notes created through the app.
- **Contact and support information**\
  Your contact details, communications with us (support emails, feedback, in-app messages) and information you provide when you respond to surveys or beta programs.
- **Usage and device information**\
  IP address, device identifiers, browser type, app version, operating system, timestamps, and basic analytics about how you use the Services (for example, which screens are accessed and how frequently).
- **Other information you choose to share**\
  Any other Personal Information you provide in the course of using the Services, contacting us, or participating in tests, pilots or promotions.

We do not intentionally collect Sensitive Information in the ordinary operation of Nuggy. If we ever need to handle Sensitive Information, we will only do so where permitted by law and with your consent where required.

## 4. How we collect Personal Information

We may collect Personal Information when:

- you sign up for an account, log in or update your profile;
- you enter information into the app (for example, rostering information, crew assignments or break details);
- your employer or another authorised user adds you as a team member in Nuggy and provides your details;
- you contact us by email, in-app support, social media or other channels;
- you respond to surveys, feedback requests or product research; or
- we receive information from third parties you have authorised (for example, your employer or integration partners).

Where it is reasonable and practical, we collect Personal Information directly from you. In some cases, we may receive your details from a third party (for example, a manager entering crew details). If we receive Personal Information about you that we did not request, we will decide whether we can keep it in line with the Act, or delete or de-identify it.

## 5. Why we collect, use and disclose Personal Information

We handle Personal Information for purposes including:

- **Providing and operating the Services**\
  Creating and managing your account, enabling shift and break management, task and checklist features, and other Nuggy functionality.
- **Communicating with you**\
  Responding to your questions, sending service-related communications, updates about features or changes, and important notices (including security or policy changes).
- **Improving Nuggy**\
  Monitoring usage at an aggregate and de-identified level to improve performance, workflows, usability and new features.
- **Security and fraud prevention**\
  Protecting the Services, accounts and data from unauthorised access, misuse or other harmful activity.
- **Legal and compliance**\
  Meeting our obligations under Australian law and cooperating with regulators where required.

We may also use your Personal Information for related secondary purposes that you would reasonably expect, or for other purposes with your consent or as permitted by law.

## 6. Direct marketing

We may use your contact details to send you information about:

- new or improved Nuggy features;
- tips, guides and content about shift management; or
- other services we think may be relevant to you.

You can opt out of marketing communications at any time by using the unsubscribe link in our emails or by contacting us using the details below. We will not provide your Personal Information to third parties for their own direct marketing without your consent.

## 7. Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose Personal Information to:

- other users within your organisation (for example, managers viewing crew shift information);
- our service providers and contractors who help us deliver the Services (for example, hosting, analytics, email delivery, customer support tools);
- professional advisers (such as accountants, auditors or lawyers) where reasonably necessary;
- third parties where you have authorised us to share information; and
- regulators, law enforcement or others where required or authorised by law.

If we disclose Personal Information to third party service providers, we require them to handle that information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and Australian privacy law.

## 8. Overseas disclosure

Some of our service providers or systems may be located outside Australia or may store data in other countries. Where Personal Information is disclosed overseas, we will take reasonable steps to ensure those recipients protect your information in a way that is consistent with Australian privacy law.

## 9. How we store and protect Personal Information

We take reasonable steps to keep Personal Information secure and to protect it from misuse, interference, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. These steps may include:

- storing information in systems with access controls;
- restricting access to staff and contractors who need it to perform their work; and
- using technical and organisational measures aligned with good industry practice.

No method of transmission or storage is completely secure. You use the Services at your own risk, and we encourage you to use strong passwords, keep your login details confidential and enable any security features we provide.

When we no longer need Personal Information for any lawful purpose, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it, unless we are required to keep it by law.

## 10. Cookies and analytics

When you use the Website or app, we and our service providers may use cookies, SDKs and similar technologies to:

- remember your preferences and settings;
- help you stay signed in;
- understand how you use the Services; and
- improve performance and user experience.

You can change your browser settings to disable or limit cookies, but this may affect some features of the Services.

## 11. Accessing and correcting your Personal Information

You have the right to request access to Personal Information we hold about you and to request corrections if you believe it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete or misleading.

To do this, please contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity before providing access or making changes. In most cases, we will not charge a fee, but we may charge reasonable administrative costs if your request is complex.

If we decide not to provide access or make a correction, we will let you know why (where reasonable) and how you can complain about our decision.
